    <p>Hello near and far internet strangers. My name is Tim Hill and I have dipped my pen in a number of different inks over the yeptoars. I have experinece in Agriculural Business, Enterprise Software Sales, Non Porfit Consulting, Web Dev, Blockchain, ad Crypto Currency. All of these skils and expierences come together to help new projects and initiatives get formed. One does not stop learnoing after college but rather life has become a continual learning process.</p>
    
    <p>When I am not glued to computer screen or consulting, I will find myself at the top of Mountain, freeskiing. Or, if it the mountains tend to be to far away, I will find myself at the beach. Happiness can be found at any elevation but I prefer sea level or higher than 7,000 feet in the clouds.</p>
